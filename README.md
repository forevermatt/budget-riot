# Budget
A simple way to budget your money and reconcile your statements.

## Priorities

1. As easy-to-use as possible.
2. "Offline first" approach.
3. As much of it as possible should be completely free.
4. Minimize cost of operations/infrastructure.
5. For features that require some level of infrastructure (and therefore
   potentially incur a cost), keep the cost _really_ low (see priority 4).
